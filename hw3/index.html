    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this challenging project, we collaborated to gradually achieve global illumination. We wrote a ray tracer
      capable of rendering semi-realistic scenes. We first worked on the basic rendering pipelining that generates rays for our pathtracer and defined intersection behaviors for primitives.
      After that, we applied the BVH acceleration.
      We also implemented hemisphere sampling and light importance sampling,
      and then further completed the code for indirect illumination. The combination of direct and indirect lighting
      completed the global illumination. Finally, we implemented adaptive sampling to further accelerate the rendering time.

      Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection (20 Points)
    </h2>
    <!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
Show images with normal shading for a few small .dae files. -->

    <h3>
      Rendering Pipeline
    </h3>
    <p>
      I first implement the `generate_ray` function. This function takes in a pixel position in the image space and
      needs to output a ray from the camera pointing to the input pixel in the world space. My implementation first
      converted the pixel position from the image space to the camera space. Then I created a ray direction vector in
      the camera space. The next step was to convert the ray direction vector in the camera space into the world space.
      This conversion was implemented by the transform matrix of the camera. After that, I normalized the ray direction
      vector and created the ray that points from the camera position to the direction of the direction vector. I also
      applied the min t and max t to the ray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second function implemented is the `raytrace_pixel`. This function also takes in a pixel position in the image
      space but is unnormalized. It then takes the given number of samples of this pixel and stores them in the sample
      buffer. I used a loop to keep track of the number of samples. For each loop, I used a `gridSampler` to get a
      random sample inside the given pixel and then normalized the coordinate for `generate_ray` to generate a ray. The
      ray was then passed into `est_radiance_global_illumination` to get the illumination information. This information
      was accumulated to the radiance variable. After the loop ended, the radiance was updated to the sampleBuffer.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>
      Intersection Algorithm
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next part is the triangle and sphere intersection function. For the triangle intersection, I used the Moller
      Trumbore algorithm taught in class, which was solving the intersection function using the ray function and the
      Barycentric coordinates of the triangle. There was an intersection if the solution of the equation happened
      between the min t and max t and the Barycentric coordinates were valid (between 0 and 1). If there was an
      intersection, I then updated the intersection object with the intersect t and also interpreted the normal vector
      by multiplying the Barycentric coordinates and the normal vectors of the three vertices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also used the sphere intersection algorithm taught in class for the sphere intersection function. The algorithm
      solved the intersection points by building an equation between the sphere and the ray. If the equation was valid
      e.g. no negative number under the square root, then there were intersection points. In this case, if one of the
      intersection t was between min t and max t, then there was an intersection. Then I updated the intersection with
      the closest intersection t. The normal vector was updated by the normalized vector pointing from the center of the
      sphere to the intersection point.

    <h3>
      BVH construction algorithm
    </h3>
    <p>
      This part implemented the BVH tree (Bounding Volume Hierarchy tree) for acceleration. The construction of the BVH
      tree first checks if the current number of elements (primitives) is less than the max leaf size allowed. If yes,
      it will simply return a leaf node with all the input elements. If the current number of elements is too large, the
      algorithm will split the primitives and recursively call the construction function to build a new node. The
      splitting algorithm first takes the average of the centroids of the bounding boxes of all primitives. Then it
      splits all the primitives along the x-axis of the average position. After all, the algorithm reorders all the
      primitives after splitting since the BVH tree needs to maintain a connected relationship. Moreover, if all the
      primitives are split to one side of the tree, the splitting point will simply be the medium element of the
      iterator. I choosed the average position as the splitting point because it can keep the spatial balance of the primitives
      unless all primitives have the same x-axis, and potentially count balance. Moreover, calculating the average position is easy and can provide a faster 
      BVH construction time. The BVH tree can also be more balanced like a balance tree and thus accelerate the rendering time from $O(n)$ to $O(log (n))$.

    <p>
      I used the gems scene and the teapot model to compare the rendering time with and without BVH acceleration. For
      both scenes, if rendered without BVH acceleration, the rendering took a few minutes to complete. However, with the
      BVH acceleration, the rendering time is shortened to a few seconds. The acceleration in rendering time is huge.
      Moreover, the BVH acceleration reduces the complexity of the test. For the gems scene, the average intersection
      per ray was reduced from 252 to 1.605. The teapot scene reduced from 433.22 to 11.52. The theoretical complexity
      reduces from $O(n)$ to $O(log (n))$.

    <p>Task1</p>
    <p>
      This is simple because to obtain the diffuse reflectance, you can directly divide the reflectance given in the
      problem statement by pi.
    </p>
    <p>
      $$f_r(\omega_i \rightarrow \omega_r)=\frac{d L_r(\omega_r)}{d E_i(\omega_i)}=\frac{d
      L_r(\omega_r)}{L_i(\omega_i)\cos \theta_i ~d \omega_i} \quad\left[\frac{1}{sr}\right]$$
    </p>
    <p>
      What's puzzling is, I don't understand why sample_f is also shown to be a task of this part (obviously, it should
      belong to part 4.1. Since I just started working on the project and am not familiar with the overall code, I spent
      a long time thinking and still don't know how to write it without any hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task2
    </p>
    <p>
      Zero reflection illumination only requires the light from the light source itself, so it is directly equal to the
      object's emitted light spectrum, making it very simple to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementing uniform hemisphere sampling is a challenging part of this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      $$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{f_r(\mathrm{p}, \omega_j \rightarrow \omega_r) L_i(\mathrm{p}, \omega_j)
      \cos\theta_j}{p(\omega_j)}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      This formula looks very abstract. After finding the pseudo-code in the slides, I seriously considered what
      information I would need. Then I realized, in fact, all I need to do in each loop is to calculate the
      corresponding three values separately and then multiply them. Therefore, the core of this part of the code is to
      understand the intersection point variables and which one should be used as the sampling direction to apply the
      formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      After carefully reading the notes written by the teaching assistant, I found it not so difficult. Every step has
      already been pointed out: calculate the cosine of the angle between vectors, project the ray, test for
      intersections, and finally normalize (also presented in the pseudo-code on the slides). Of course, don't forget to
      set the ray field to a small constant. The main function should also be updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, surprisingly, the rendering result did not look good.
    </p>

    <img src="imag/debug3-3-1.png" alt="">

    <p>
      After carefully checking, I still could not find the problem. Looking at the edited version, I realized that the
      problem might be due to not setting the same coordinate system when calculating the product with the normal
      vector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it looks good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task4
    </p>
    <p>
      Our results from uniform hemisphere sampling are very noisy! Although they will converge to the correct result, we
      can do better! I think so too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code for importance sampling looks really complex, with a lot of information, but I still patiently read
      through the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previously, when dealing with the hemisphere function, I didn't think too much and directly calculated wi and
      w_out, which caused me great confusion between the world coordinate system and the local coordinate system. I
      realized my thinking wasn't deep enough before. This also made me understand why it's necessary to write code by
      hand after class to truly master it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't understand which tests I should perform, or what values to substitute into the formulas. After repeatedly
      reviewing the slides and discussions, I had no choice but to ask GPT. I learned that:
    </p>

    <ui>
      <li>
        In the world coordinate system: When directly using positions, directions, and normals from the scene for
        calculations, you don't need to perform additional coordinate transformations. This is usually sufficient for
        global illumination calculations and visual effects.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the local coordinate system: When performing calculations specific to the surface of an object (such as
        calculating BRDF), it may be necessary to transform relevant vectors (such as incident light wi and reflected
        light wo) into the local coordinate system. The Z-axis of the local coordinate system is usually aligned with
        the normal of the object's surface, which simplifies calculations because you can directly use the components of
        the coordinates (for example, the Z component represents the angle with the normal) for calculations.
      </li>
    </ui>

    <p>
      World Coordinate System:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Light source position: The positions of light sources are set relative to the entire scene, so they are usually
        defined in the world coordinate system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Camera position and orientation: The position and orientation of the camera are also usually defined relative to
        the entire scene, so they are in the world coordinate system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Object's global position: The position of objects, if relative to the origin of the scene, is usually defined in
        the world coordinate system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Normals at the intersection point (isect.n): If the calculation considers the object's global transformations
        (such as rotation and displacement), then these normals are usually defined in the world coordinate system.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Local (Intersection) Coordinate System:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Points on the object's surface: If you are dealing with specific points on the object's surface (such as texture
        mapping, normal mapping, etc.), the coordinates of these points may be defined in the object's local coordinate
        system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vectors in tangent space: Used for specific shading calculations, such as normal mapping, these vectors are in
        tangent space (a special type of local coordinate system).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I gradually understood what those w20 at the beginning of the function were, which means I just need to perform
      the intersection test in the same coordinate system and then apply the formula as usual. Here, I wrote parts to
      handle area lights and point lights separately, filling in the framework with physical and ray intersection tests,
      and checking for backside lighting. I had GPT check if it was in the same coordinate system to see if there were
      any problems. The prompt also told me to subtract EPS_F to avoid self-intersection.

      Although they look similar, it can be observed that the number of noise points in the scene decreases as the
      number of rendering rays increases. Due to the low sampling rate, when the number of rays is 1, visible noise dots
      are present on both the walls and the rabbit, as well as in the rabbit's shadow. After increasing the number of
      rays to 4, the amount of noise drops significantly, but the edges of the shadows still have many noise dots.
      Continuing to increase to 16, the image becomes much cleaner, though there are still some faint noise dots.
      Finally, when the number of rays is 64, the shadows are relatively clear, and the noise is not obvious.

    <p>
      Through comparison, it can be found that compared to uniform hemisphere sampling, importance sampling, which
      prioritizes the contribution of light sources in the scene, yields better results: the scene is cleaner, with
      significantly fewer noise dots. Light importance sampling produces smoother and more realistic soft shadow
      effects. Uniform hemisphere sampling leads to more noise dots and inconsistencies at the edges of shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      For highlights and reflective surfaces, light importance sampling provides more accurate and sharper details
      because it more effectively samples the important light rays in these areas. This makes the scene bright and
      accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rendering, images using light importance sampling usually converge faster to a lower level of noise, but the
      computational cost is higher than that of uniform hemisphere sampling.

      This task was truly torturous. It took me about 10 hours to complete it and the writing part. For reflections more
      than once, in fact, you only need to understand a single reflection well to be able to complete it quickly. The
      task provided many hints, first gradually decreasing the depth of the reflected light rays to meet the recursive
      exit condition, calculating the value of the current light formula before each recursion, and then recursing the
      reflected light rays, thus enabling the calculation of multiple reflections added together. The real trouble with
      this task was that when I started, my teammate hadn't finished the second part, so I was almost unable to do the
      indirect lighting rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most troublesome part wasn't the function implementation, but the writing part. First, I found it
      impossible to render 1024 pixels locally; even 64 pixels took me a long time to train. That's when I understood
      why the homework hints suggested checking the correctness of the results with low pixels first. In the end, I had
      to seek help from Hive. One problem with Hive is that sometimes when I was rendering on a server, someone else
      might be using it too, resulting in CPU overflow and the images not being saved, which was a waste of time.

      Russian Roulette was easier to implement, you just need to clarify that the input to the random function is the
      termination probability, and divide the original result by the non-termination probability value. I set the
      termination probability at 35%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next was the writing part, starting with outputting only the part with direct lighting, which is actually part 3,
      and the part without lighting gave me many bugs. How to implement returning only the part of the light reflected
      this time was another challenge. So, I went to two hw parties and gradually understood the key to the problem. It
      is essential to understand the current light's depth and the relationship between the total depth of light and the
      actual number of light reflections. Most importantly, remember not to accumulate light after judging the number of
      reflections (note that this must be after determining the intersection); if the current light is not needed,
      return to the initial value directly. This made me think more deeply about the meaning of the code.

      You can see that the combination of the two adds up to a complete global illumination image. Direct lighting
      includes light that comes directly from the light source as well as light that is directly reflected from objects
      or walls, hence the light sources and walls are bright, but the side of the object that is away from the light
      source is dark. Indirect lighting includes light that is reflected from all other objects, so the light sources
      are dark, but the walls and objects are illuminated, and the colors are very soft, while the side facing the light
      source is darker, which is exactly the opposite of direct lighting.

      We can see that when the depth is 0, only the light sources are displayed. When not accumulating reflected light,
      the image becomes darker as the number of reflections increases. This is because when light reflects from one
      surface to another, a part of the light energy is absorbed, leading to a decrease in the intensity of the
      reflected light. Therefore, with more reflections, there is less light energy, and the rendered image becomes
      darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rendering images, the second bounce of light means that the light first hits a surface from the light source
      and then bounces to another surface, providing additional light for objects in the scene. This adds richer shadow
      details and color bleeding effects when rendering images, making the scene look softer and more realistic. The
      third bounce further enhances the effect of indirect lighting, especially in darker areas or between complex
      geometric shapes. These light bounces add detail to the image, better representing subtle changes in lighting,
      delicate shadow transitions, and reflections of color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to rasterization techniques, path tracing requires longer computation times but provides better rendering
      results for complex scenes and materials. The indirect reflection of light in global illumination can capture the
      effect of an object's surface color affecting adjacent surfaces, enhancing the realism and richness of the scene.
      Rasterization methods, on the other hand, struggle to directly simulate this type of indirect lighting effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      When accumulating light depth, we can see that as the light depth increases, the rendering effect becomes more
      realistic, the scene gets brighter, and more "shadowed areas" are illuminated, displaying richer details and
      variations in light and shadow.

      The results for depths of 0-4 are similar to the previous parts, with depth 0 being the light source, and as the
      depth increases, the brightness of the scene increases, rendering it richer and more realistic. It can be noted
      that there isn't a significant difference at a depth of 100 (of course, if you switch between images continuously,
      you can see that compared to depth 4, the brightness and richness have increased). This is because a 35%
      termination probability is set, so although the depth is 100, after many bounces, the probability of a
      theoretically expected termination event is already high, making it difficult to exceed a certain number of
      bounces (such as 15). Therefore, even with a set maximum depth of 100, no significant changes are displayed.。

    <h3>
      Adaptive sampling algorithm
    </h3>
    <p>
      This part implements adaptive sampling, which provides extra acceleration by applying different sample rates to
      different pixels. The adaptive sampling algorithm is based on statistics to determine whether a sample is
      converged
      (having enough samples to avoid noise). It uses two variables to keep track of the accumulated illuminance and the
      square of the illuminance. $s_1 = \Sigma_0^n{\text{illum}}, s_2 = \Sigma_0^n{\text{illum} ^2}$ With these two
      variables, the algorithm calculates an indicator of convergence using the variance of all n samples $\sigma^2 =
      \frac{1}{n-1}\cdot(s_2 - \frac{s_1^2}{n}), I = 1.96 \cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. The threshold to predict
      convergence will be calculated by the mean of all samples and the tolerance inputted by commands $\mu =
      \frac{s_1}{n}, \text{thres} = maxTolerance \cdot \mu$. Once the indicator is not greater than the threshold, it
      means the pixel converges, and it will stop sampling.

    <h2>Cooperation Experience</h2>
    <p>Mian: </p>
    <p>
      For projects like this, where the implementation of later parts relies on the code from earlier sections, it has
      taught me that starting homework earlier is essential. Managing the project and debugging code is very
      challenging, and it becomes even more difficult to identify whose mistake it is when a bug is encountered.
      Additionally, to prepare for exams, I also need to learn the parts completed by my teammates. I am grateful for my
      teammates' contributions; completing this project was truly not easy.
    </p>
    <p>Jaxon: </p>
    <p>
      This is a hard, long project that requires a lot of logical management. Thus, cooperation is important but
      difficult since we need to keep
      updated and manage our overall rendering pipeline. Luckily, we communicated a lot and kept up to date, although
      sometimes we still encountered some bugs.
      But we still successfully completed this project, and I'm so grateful for my partner.
