    <p>
      In this project, we implemented the cloth simulator and also different
      types of shaders based on GLSL. We first modeled the cloth as a grid of
      point masses and applied constraints to the cloth by adding different
      types of springs. ......(p2,3,4). At last, we implemented different
      shaders using different shading methods such as diffuse shading,
      Blinn-Phong shading, displacement and bump mapping, and
      environment-mapped reflection.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
  </a>
  <h4 align="middle">Overview</h4>
  <p>
    In the first part, we build the basic structure for cloth simulation. The
    cloth is modeled as a grid of point masses to represent the mechanical
    properties of the cloth. To simulate the forces acting on the cloth and
    also the forces between the point masses in the cloth, we also added the
    spring structures for force simulation. There are three types of springs:
    structural, shearing, and bending. These three types have different ways
    to connect to point masses and provide different functions in force
    simulation. The structural and shearing springs connect all neighboring
    masses and simulate the forces of compressing and stretching. The bending
    springs connect point masses that are one point mass away and provide
    resistance in the out-of-plane direction.

    This part might seem simple, but I noticed the colors are incorrect at the beginning.
    From Ed, I learned: "Thank you Derek for answering the question! Color does matter here. This issue is most likely
    because your point masses are being added into the vector in an incorrect order. Make sure you are storing the
    point
    masses in the point_masses vector IN ROW-MAJOR (X-AXIS) ORDER for part 1."

  <p>The spring constant affects the stiffness of the fabric in cloth simulation. When the spring constant is very low,
    the fabric appears softer and significantly droopier. Throughout the process from start to rest, such fabric
    displays large, slow-moving waves, and because the springs representing the fabric are very weak, unable to
    effectively resist the forces applied to them, it takes longer to stabilize to a resting state. Conversely, a high
    spring constant makes the fabric appear stiffer. This means it resists bending and deformation, resulting in
    smaller, faster vibrations and a shorter stabilization time. The fabric maintains its shape better under external
    forces, exhibiting less drooping.</p>

  <p>According to Newton's second law, the effect of density is unrelated to the properties of the spring itself and
    related to gravity. It is observed from the graph that the higher the density, the greater the mass, and the denser
    fabric will droop more due to its own weight, possibly leading to lower hanging and slower movement speeds. This
    means the springs are further stretched. Reducing density results in less drooping and may present a lighter
    appearance.</p>

  <p>Damping represents the motion resistance that reduces amplitude. Although it does not significantly affect the
    state after rest, it affects the time from falling to rest. From the graph, the greater the damping, the easier it
    is to come to rest. Whereas low damping will lead to noticeable and longer oscillations before stabilization.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
  </a>
  <p>In this section, I implemented collisions between spheres, planes, and other objects. The most critical logic is
    that for different objects, it is necessary to check the current and nearest positions to determine whether it has
    "passed through" another object. If so, it is equivalent to a collision occurring. The new position is then
    corrected to bring it "back" to somewhere on the previous side.</p>
  <p>Handling collisions with spheres:</p>
  <p>Calculate vector: The vector from the point mass to the center of the sphere.</p>
  <p>Check for collision: If the vector's length is less than the radius of the sphere, the point is inside the sphere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Calculate correction: Move the point to the surface of the sphere, considering friction.
    Handling collisions with planes:
  </p>
  <p>Determine if passing through: The dot product of the point mass's position and the plane's normal vector.</p>
  <p>Calculate the tangent point: If passing through, calculate the tangent point from the position before passing
    through to the plane.</p>
  <p>Apply correction: Consider friction and correct the point's position.</p>
  <p>During the simulation of each frame, iterate over all point masses, performing the above collision detection and
    correction for each point.</p>

      <p>Low Density: The low density of the fabric makes it less susceptible to the effects of gravity, resulting in a
        slower descent. When low-density fabric comes into contact with a surface, its lower momentum makes it more
        susceptible to the influence of air resistance and other external forces, resulting in larger creases and
        ripples. As this fabric touches the surface, due to its lighter mass, there's a greater mass displacement
        parallel to the surface, thus forming larger and less tight creases.</p>
      <p>High Density: Increased density adds weight to the fabric, causing it to be subject to greater gravitational
        force, thus falling faster. Its momentum is also greater. When such fabric comes into contact with a surface or
        itself, its inertia causes it to resist significant shape changes, resulting in smaller and tighter folds and
        creases. The mass distribution of high-density fabric also means that at any given point of contact, it
        experiences greater gravity, causing it to stabilize more quickly and exhibit smaller ripples or folds.</p>

      <p>Low Ks: A low spring constant makes the fabric more susceptible to stretching and deformation. This results in
        the fabric exhibiting more bending and folding during self-collisions, requiring a longer time to reach a state
        of rest. Ultimately, there are more creases, which is a consequence of good extensibility.</p>
      <p>High Ks: A high spring constant allows the fabric to quickly correct minor deformations in simulations of
        self-collision, resulting in a stiff appearance with a smooth surface.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This part is different from previous parts in that it is about shaders
        instead of cloth simulation. We used a different language, called GLSL.
        GLSL allows us to render effects on GPU that is on a different pipeline
        working parallel to the cloth simulation. It offers a faster rendering
        method than the slow ray tracing we implemented before.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two basic types of shaders. The first one is the vertex shader.
        It transforms the vertices and modifies their geometric properties. The
        second one is the fragment shader. It takes in the geometric properties of
        fragments and output the colors of those fragments after rasterization.

          Blinn-Phong model.
        </b>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Blinn-Phong shading is composed of three types of lighting: ambient
        lighting, diffuse lighting, and specular lighting. The ambient lighting
        can be considered as the uniform reflection of all light received at that
        point. The diffuse lighting depends on the angle of the surface to the
        light. The closer the surface normal to the incoming direction of the
        light, the brighter the reflection. Last of all, the specular lighting
        brings a glare effect on the reflection. The effect of specular lighting
        is calculated by both light incoming direction and the outgoing direction.

      <p>
        I controlled the coarseness of the displacement mapping by changing the
        shading parameters from `-o 16 -a 16` to `-o 128 -a 128`. On the left
        side, we rendered the sphere with a lower resolution. As a result, the
        displacement happens smoother. On the right side, the sphere is rendered
        with a much higher resolution. Thus, the displacement matches a higher
        frequency and thus causes a coarser surface.
